# internal/dist Package

This package defines interfaces and components for distributed training. It will support multiple distributed training patterns (e.g., Parameter Server, All-Reduce):contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21} and handle inter-node communication (using gRPC) for exchanging parameters and gradients:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}.

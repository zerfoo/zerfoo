# internal/graph Package

This package defines the data structures for Zerfoo's computational graph, representing operations and their dependencies. It allows building a graph of nodes (operations/variables) and will manage execution order for forward and backward passes, similar to how frameworks like Gorgonia compile a graph for execution:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.

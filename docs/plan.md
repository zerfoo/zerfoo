# Project Plan: BFloat16 Production Enhancement with Feature Parity

## 1. Context

### 1.1. Problem Statement

The BFloat16 implementation in the float16 package currently lacks proper rounding modes, conversion modes, error handling, and mathematical functions that are available in the Float16 implementation. This asymmetry makes BFloat16 unsuitable for production use in the "zerfoo" machine learning framework. The current implementation uses simple truncation for float32-to-BFloat16 conversion and lacks configurable rounding modes, which can lead to numerical instability and accuracy issues in machine learning applications.

### 1.2. Objectives and Non-Goals

**Objectives:**
- Implement configurable rounding modes for BFloat16 conversions matching Float16 capabilities
- Add conversion mode support (IEEE vs Strict) with proper error handling
- Implement comprehensive mathematical functions for BFloat16
- Achieve feature parity between BFloat16 and Float16 implementations
- Ensure proper handling of subnormal numbers in BFloat16
- Add slice operations with error handling for BFloat16
- Implement FloatClass classification for BFloat16
- Add CopySign and other utility functions matching Float16

**Non-Goals:**
- This project will not change the BFloat16 bit format (1 sign, 8 exponent, 7 mantissa)
- This project will not modify existing Float16 functionality
- This project will not implement hardware-specific optimizations
- This project will not add SIMD or vectorized operations

### 1.3. Constraints and Assumptions

- All work must be implemented in Go using standard library only
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing BFloat16 API where possible
- Must follow IEEE 754 semantics for special values and edge cases
- Performance should be comparable to Float16 operations
- All code must pass existing test suites

### 1.4. Success Metrics

- All BFloat16 operations support configurable rounding modes
- BFloat16 conversions support both IEEE and Strict modes with proper error reporting
- All mathematical functions available for Float16 are also available for BFloat16
- Complete test coverage for new BFloat16 functionality
- All tests pass with correct rounding behavior
- Performance benchmarks show no significant regression

## 2. Scope and Deliverables

- Adding slice operations with mode support for BFloat16
- Implementing FloatClass and classification methods for BFloat16

## 5. Operating Procedure

- **Definition of Done:** A task is complete when implementation passes all tests, code is formatted with go fmt, passes golangci-lint checks, and has been committed with a descriptive message
- **QA Steps:** Run go test ./... after each implementation task to ensure no regressions
- **Testing:** Always add unit tests for new functionality before marking task complete
- **Formatting:** Always run go fmt ./... after code changes
- **Linting:** Always run golangci-lint run after code changes
- **Commits:** Never commit files from different directories together; make small logical commits
- **Review:** Code should follow existing patterns in float16 package for consistency

## 6. Progress Log

- **2025 08 25: Change Summary**
  - Created comprehensive plan for BFloat16 production enhancement
  - Defined 8 epics covering rounding, conversion modes, math functions, utilities, slicing, testing, integration, and performance
  - Established 3-day timeline with clear milestones
  - Prioritized core rounding infrastructure as foundation for other features

- **2025 08 24: Previous Entry**
  - Plan for adding static assertions for interface implementations was documented

## 7. Hand-off Notes

- **Context:** Review the existing Float16 implementation in float16.go, convert.go, and math.go to understand patterns to follow
- **Key Files:** Primary work will be in bfloat16.go with new files for bfloat16_math.go and updates to convert.go
- **Testing:** Use bfloat16_test.go and create comprehensive test cases mirroring float16_test.go structure
- **Dependencies:** No external dependencies; uses only Go standard library
- **Build:** Standard go build ./... and go test ./... commands
- **Documentation:** Update package comments to reflect new BFloat16 capabilities

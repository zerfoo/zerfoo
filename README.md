# Zerfoo

**Zerfoo** is a modular, accelerator-ready machine learning framework written entirely in Go.  
It is being built to train and serve state-of-the-art models like Transformers using float8/16/32/64 precision.  
The framework will support ONNX model import, dynamic graph construction, and low-level optimization primitives to enable AGI-scale systems.

> **Status**: Pre-release ‚Äî actively in development.  
> **Goal**: Build a powerful, production-ready ML stack in Go from the ground up.

## üåç Vision

While Python dominates the ML landscape, it wasn't designed for low-latency, modular, and concurrent systems.  
Zerfoo will bring:

- ‚úÖ Strong typing and compile-time safety
- ‚úÖ Native concurrency (goroutines, channels)
- ‚úÖ Fine-grained memory control
- ‚úÖ Performance via custom backends, BLAS, and GPU acceleration
- ‚úÖ Native support for low-precision formats (float8, float16)

We believe Go is the ideal language to scale intelligent systems beyond the limitations of Pythonic stacks.

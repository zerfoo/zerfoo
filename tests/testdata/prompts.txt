The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
To be or not to be, that is the question
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
Call me Ishmael
It is a truth universally acknowledged
In the beginning was the Word
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again
Once upon a time in a land far, far away
The sun was shining on the sea
When in the course of human events
Four score and seven years ago
We hold these truths to be self-evident
I have a dream
Ask not what your country can do for you
That's one small step for man
Houston, we have a problem
May the force be with you
I'll be back
Show me the money
Here's looking at you, kid
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn
Go ahead, make my day
You can't handle the truth
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse
Say hello to my little friend
Nobody puts Baby in a corner
Life is like a box of chocolates
You talking to me?
I see dead people
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer
After all, tomorrow is another day
There's no place like home
I feel the need, the need for speed
Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads
Wax on, wax off
Use the force, Luke
Do or do not, there is no try
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi
These aren't the droids you're looking for
I find your lack of faith disturbing
The force is strong with this one
I am your father
Search your feelings, you know it to be true
Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy
I love you. I know.
Never tell me the odds
It's a trap!
Stay on target
